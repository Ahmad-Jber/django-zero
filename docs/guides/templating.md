# Templating

Although django template language has been around since forever in django, we find it more convenient to use `jinja2`
for a lot of tasks.

Projects comes bundled with **both** DTL and Jinja2 installed and configured, so you can leverage the best of both
worlds.

Just place your DTL templates in your application's `templates` directories (or your project's `resources/templates`
directory) and your Jinja2 templates in your application's `jinja2` directories (or your project's `resources/jinja2`
directory).
