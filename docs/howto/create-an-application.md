# How to create an app?

Creating a `django-zero` application is easy, and can be done in a few different ways.

## The easy way: use the CLI

Change your working directory to your django-zero project's root directory, and run:

```shell
$ django-zero create app hello
```

It will create a `hello` application in `apps/hello`.

## The expert way: it's just django, stupid

Of course, django-zero applications are just django applications. 
Any way that would work with django will work here.
